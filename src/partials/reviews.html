              Chocolate is a family favourite treat. Love the delicious smooth
              chocolate and the creaminess inside. The wafer is soft but
              crunchy.

              This is delicious. It so rich and flavorful you donâ€™t need to use
              as many. I love topping an apple with almond butter and these
              chips for a snack.
